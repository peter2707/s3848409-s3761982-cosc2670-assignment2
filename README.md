    - gvedit.exe is required to view Decision Tree Model

- Run the App on local machine

1. Open Anaconda Navigator

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook

3. Using the Jupyter window in the browser, navigate to the project directory

4. Open the project file (.ipynb)

5. Go to Kernel -> Restart & Run All

6. From there, the output of the script should be viewable

### To View Decision Tree Model

1. Make sure you have executed every cell in the Jupyter Notebook

2. Open gvedit.exe

3. Select File -> Open

4. Navigate to "heart_failure.dot" file

5. And you should be able to view the tree graph by scrolling in the "View" window

## To Clean Up:
